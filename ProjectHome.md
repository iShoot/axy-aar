Arma 3 Addon, Extension and reporting tool that creates after action reports based on ingame missions.

## Mass AAR Prototype ##

See [here](https://code.google.com/p/axy-aar/wiki/MassAAR_intro).

## Very Much Alpha Code ##

Download version 0.4 from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3w2Hwg2Q0mXTFFzVkc2UkdCV1k/edit?usp=sharing).

0.4 Changes:
  * AAR file now includes a version number, so the reporting tools can work with different versions.
  * Includes a config file that lets you set a bunch of things like...
    * Whether to track the group leader or you.
    * How often to update position.
    * When to timeout on a contact (after how many seconds of no hits/firing)
    * How thick to draw the lines in the aarShow mission.
    * What distance to ignore between two points when showing a mission AAR - i.e. to get rid of teleport issues.
  * Leader changes are now recorded/shown.
  * Members of group are noted in the contact report.

This addon is currently client side only.  It only tracks the group you're in and is designed for infantry.

**Requires**
  * CBA

**Known Issues:**
  * Does not track any firing from vehicles.
